    Aidan Lowson, a Software Engineer from the UK. Programming since 2012 and
    working with some big bois in the UK since 2018. In recent years I've been
    more pasisonate than ever about the ever evolving world of programming after
    spending a number of years just coding for the pay-cheque (don't tell my old
    boss).
